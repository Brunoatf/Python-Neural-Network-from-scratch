# Python-Neural-Network-from-scratch

The goal of this project is to implement a functioning neural network in Python without using Deep Learning libraries, and then test how accurately it can predict the curve of a cosine function. The code contains the classes for building neurons, layers and networks, and, also, the instructions to create a simple animation of the newtork learning the curve mentioned.
